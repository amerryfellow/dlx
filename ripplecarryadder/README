The behavioral solution isn't taking into account any output carry. In order to generate it, a simple and straightforward solution might be the use of a temporary 7-bit signal ( one more than the original 6 bits ), and split it in 2 parts: the first 6 bits will contain the sum, while the last ( 6th ) one will contain the carry out.

An example of such an implementation is provided below.

architecture BEHAVIORAL of RCA is
	signal sum : std_logic_vector(6 downto 0) := (others=>'0');
	begin
		sum	<= ('0' & A) + B + Ci after DRCAS;	-- Temporary signal
		S	<= sum(5 downto 0);					-- Sum
		Co	<= sum(6);							-- Carry out
end BEHAVIORAL;
